        <h3 class="lb_heading">Fearless</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Fearless (Taylor&apos;s Version) is the first of Taylor Swift&apos;s
          rerecorded albums, which she created to regain ownership of the six
          albums she created under Big Machine Records. It includes a new
          version of every song on Fearless Platinum Edition, along with
          standalone single “Today Was a Fairytale” and six songs she cut from
          the original 2008 Fearless album.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          On February 11, 2021, Swift appeared on Good Morning America to
          announce her re-recording of “Love Story”, which came out that night
          at midnight, and Fearless.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Later that morning, Swift posted a letter to fans on Instagram,
          thanking them for their support and expressing her excitement about
          the project. For her first five albums, she left hidden notes via
          capitalized letters in her album booklets, and she continued this
          tradition to hide the message “April Ninth” in the note, revealing the
          release date.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Speak Now</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Speak Now is a song by Taylor Swift which expresses her wish to stop
          her ex-boyfriend from marrying the wrong person. It was inspired by a
          dream Taylor had about one of her exes, and from a conversation with a
          friend, in which their ex boyfriend was getting married to someone
          else as well. The song is meant to be a metaphor for not being scared
          to speak your mind before it&apos;s too late. It is speculated that
          the song is about two members of Paramore, Hayley Williams and Josh
          Farro.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Red</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Taylor Swift&apos;s fourth studio album, released in October 2012, was
          inspired by intense emotions and feelings that Swift believes
          correlate with the color red, including frustration, romance,
          disappointment, and nostalgia. Swift broadened the spectrum with a
          Target-exclusive deluxe edition.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          The Red era kicked off with a livestream in August 2012, in which
          Swift announced the album and debuted “We Are Never Ever Getting Back
          Together,” which became her first #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Swift
          admitted during the livestream that she wrote over thirty songs for
          the album. She later gave one particular reject, “Babe,” to Sugarland,
          and she featured on the track.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">1989</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          1989 was Swift&apos;s official entrance to the pop music scene, and it
          cemented her status as a musical titan. It was the only album of 2014
          to sell over a million copies in its first week, and spent five
          non-consecutive weeks at #1.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          After her 2012 record Red didn&apos;t win the Grammy for Album Of The
          Year, Swift stepped back and decided she may have a better chance if
          she changed her sound. That night, she vowed to go in a completely
          different direction in hopes that her next album would win the award —
          and it did, making Swift both the first woman to win the award twice
          and the first to win it for two genres, since her 2008 record,
          Fearless, won in 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Swift kicked off the 1989 era with a livestream and the release of
          lead single “Shake It Off,” which became one of her biggest hits and
          earned Swift her first diamond single by March 2020. Swift went on to
          release “Blank Space,” “Style,” “Bad Blood,” “Wildest Dreams,” “Out Of
          The Woods,” and “New Romantics” as singles. In addition, “Welcome To
          New York” was used in tourism ads for the city that served as the
          track&apos;s inspiration.

          The Reputation Prologue is the introduction to reputation, and is
          featured on the first page of both the CD booklet and in the
          Target-exclusive magazines. Here, Taylor talks about the different
          ways a person is known or perceived by other people, based on the
          version of themself that the person has chosen to show.

        <p class="lb_text">
          The full album tracklist was allegedly leaked by iTunes on August 14,
          two days before the title track “Lover” was officially released. Two
          days later, Taylor Swift officially announced the tracklist in
          multiple Instagram posts, confirming what the leak had already
          revealed two days earlier.
